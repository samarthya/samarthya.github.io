## 🚀 Getting Started

Attempt at redoing my profile page via Quarto! It is good that Boston University started with this. Gave a good idea around how old the previous deployment was!!

### Prerequisites

What I need to get started!

- [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/) (latest version)
- Python 3.12 or higher (for any Python-based content)
- VSCode with Quarto extension (recommended)

### Local Development

Process I followed!

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/samarthya/samarthya.github.io.git
   cd samarthya.github.io
   ```

2. Create and activate Python virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python3.12 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Unix/macOS
   # or
   .\venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
   ```

3. Preview the site:

   ```bash
   quarto preview
   ```

## 🎨 Customization

### Styling

- Custom styles are defined in `styles.css`
- The site uses the `journal` theme with Font Awesome icons
- Layout and styling can be modified through:
  - `_quarto.yml` for global settings
  - Individual `.qmd` files for page-specific settings

### Adding Content

1. Create new `.qmd` files for new pages
2. Add page references to `_quarto.yml` under the `navbar` section
3. Use Quarto's markdown extensions for rich content:
   - Code blocks with syntax highlighting
   - Math equations
   - Tables
   - Cross-references
   - Citations
